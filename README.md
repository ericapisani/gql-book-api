## GraphQL Day Toronto 2019 Project

This is the project that was used as my proof of concept when I was testing out TypeGraphQL for my talk on 'Managing TypeScript and GraphQL Types in Node'.

The code that was used in the talk is in the TypeGraphQL folder, and the base that I started out with (which was essentially slightly modified tutorial code) is in the 'original version' folder.
